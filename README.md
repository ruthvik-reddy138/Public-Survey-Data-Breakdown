Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize the results of a professional survey conducted with 630 respondents. The goal was to provide insights into various dimensions such as participant demographics, job roles, salary distribution, programming language preferences, geographical distribution, and job satisfaction.

Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Utilized Power BI to create dynamic and interactive charts, maps, and graphs for in-depth analysis.
Data Analysis: Explored and visualized key metrics including average salary by role, favorite programming languages, and work-life balance satisfaction.
Geographical Insights: Mapped participants' countries of residence to understand geographical distribution and its impact on job satisfaction and role preferences.
Role and Salary Insights: Analyzed the average salary associated with different job roles and presented findings in a clear, comparative format.
Programming Language Preferences: Showcased the popularity of various programming languages among survey participants.
Satisfaction Metrics: Evaluated and visualized participants' satisfaction with work-life balance and salary.
